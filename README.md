# Pixel Sprite Studio

Pixel Sprite Studio is an animation tool for pixel art characters. It lets you organize all your character art in a single project and composite animations from individual pieces—useful for quick drafting or creating final, ready-to-use animations.

This is not a graphics editor. You import your own art and use Pixel Sprite Studio to assemble and animate it, then export to spritesheets.

## Features

- Part-based characters with multiple states and pre-drawn rotations
- Per-animation FPS control
- Spritesheet export
- Self-contained `.pss` project files

## Building

```bash
cargo build --release
```
